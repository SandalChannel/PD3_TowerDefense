# Tower Defense Unity Prototype Demo

This is a small Tower Defense game prototype in Unity, specifically focussing on MVP, the SOLID principles, and de-coupled code.

> **_NOTE:_** This implementation uses a personalised variant of MVP, Logic/Display. This works the same as MVP, but combines Presenter and View into Display.

This is the final project for Platform Development 3 (Digital Arts & Entertainment). Therefore this code is owned by Howest.
